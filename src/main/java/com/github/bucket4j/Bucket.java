/**
 * The continuous-state leaky bucket can be viewed as a finite capacity bucket
 * whose real-valued content drains out at a continuous rate of 1 unit of content per time unit
 * and whose content is increased by the increment T for each conforming cell...
 * If at a cell arrival the content of the bucket is less than or equal to the limit value Ï„, then the cell is conforming;
 * otherwise, the cell is non-conforming.
 * <p>
 * <p>Simple example of usage:
 * <code><pre>
 * Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder().addLimit(100, Duration.ofMinutes(1)).build();
 * ...
 * if (bucket.tryConsumeSingleToken()) {
 *     doSomething();
 * }
 * <pre/>
